Malicious extensions can:

Steal data: Log keystrokes, read emails, capture passwords.
Hijack browsing: Redirect to phishing sites, insert ads.
Use system resources: Mine cryptocurrency, slow down PC.
Monitor behavior: Track online activity and sell data.

Example of real-world cases:

The DataSpii scandal (2019) exposed sensitive user data via browser extensions.
Malicious Chrome extensions with millions of users were found to steal credentials in 2020.
